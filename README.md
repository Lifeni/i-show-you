## Quick Start

It is recommended to use Docker Compose for deployment.

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file in the repo to your own machine. It is best to choose a separate folder, because the application configuration file will be stored in the `folder/configs/main.yml`.

2. Create a new `main.yml` file and place it in the `folder/configs/main.yml` with the following content.

    ```yml
    server:
      jwt-secret:
        file: golang
        admin: password
    
    admin:
      password: 1234
    ```

    For detailed configuration, please see [Configuration | I Show You](https://lifeni.github.io/i-show-you/config/) .

3. Execute the following command in the folder to start the container.

    ```shell
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    The `-d` command stands for background execution, and you can view real-time output if you remove it.

> Note: The application exposes port 8080 by default. If there is a port conflict or you want to use your own MongoDB, you can modify the yml file yourself.

## Documentation

The documentation is being written. (Currently only available in Chinese)

See https://lifeni.github.io/i-show-you .

## Demo

The application is currently under development, and the data may be cleared at any time.

See https://i-show-you.dev.lifeni.life .

## Troubleshooting

### Your device may not support editing

The application uses [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) as the editor, and this editor currently does not support mobile browser and mobile frameworks. If you still want to edit, there may be problems such as failure to delete and text loss.

For more information about Monaco Editor, you can view [microsoft/monaco-editor: A browser based code editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor#monaco-editor).
